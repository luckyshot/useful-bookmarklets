# Useful Bookmarklets

#### A simple Chrome extension that lists useful actions based on the website you're in.



The extension is completely free and privacy-friendly, there are no trackers and it only activates when you click it. It's a tiny little extension that I built for myself because I use a ton of bookmarklets on my day to day, and cared to share with everyone hoping it helps you become more productive.

New actions/bookmarklets will be added as I come across new ideas, feedback welcome!

Feel free to submit Pull Requests with more bookmarklets (these need to be converted back to vanilla JavaScript code to comply with Google's Manifest V3 security limitations).
