Useful Bookmarklets

A simple Chrome extension that lists useful actions based on the website you're in.

The extension is completely free and privacy-friendly, there are no trackers. It's a tiny little extension that I found extremely useful and cared to share with everyone hoping it helps in your day to day.

New actions/bookmarklets will be added as I come across new ideas, feedback welcome!
