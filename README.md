Useful Bookmarklets is a tiny little extension that groups many bookmarklets together in a single button and only displays the ones you need based on the website you're currently visiting.

I built it for myself because I use a ton of bookmarklets on my day to day and wanted to share it with everyone hoping it helps you become more productive.

The extension is completely free and privacy-friendly, there are no trackers and it only activates when you click it, some bookmarklets use other website's services, hover with your mouse on each bookmarklet to learn more about each of them.

New actions/bookmarklets are added as I come across new ideas, feedback welcome.

Feel free to submit Pull Requests with more bookmarklets (these need to be converted back to vanilla JavaScript code to comply with Google's Manifest V3 security limitations).
